# Google Gemini Powered-Voice Chatbot on Raspberry Pi

Previously, I built a voice assistant (chatbot) with Raspberry Pi, Python, and OpenAI ChatGPT API. In this project, I changed it to use Google's Gemini API. This version has been tested on Raspberry Pi 4 model B. The no-LED version of the code (GVA4Pi1_NoLED.py) works on both Raspberry Pi and Windows.

## Install Python and Packages 
You will need to install the following packages to run this code:

If you have Python 3.12 or newer, also install the "setuptools" package,

You may need to create a Python virtual environment first.
